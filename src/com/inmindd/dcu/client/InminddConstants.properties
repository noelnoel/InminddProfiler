A trial is a research study that compares one type of care with another type of care in order to find out if one is more effective than the other. In the trial we are comparing an online dementia risk assessment (the In-MINDD profiler) and internet-based support system (the In-MINDD support environment) with routine practice. The trial is for people aged 40âˆ’60 years in the primary care setting.

landing_profiler_3 = <p>The In-MINDD profiler is an online questionnaire for people aged 40-60 years. It assesses the presence or absence of a range of factors that are known to either increase or decrease a person&rsquo;s risk of developing dementia in later life. The factors we are assessing are related to lifestyle (e.g. smoking, obesity, physical activity) and can be either modified or managed by lifestyle changes. The In-MINDD profiler has been developed by the In-MINDD research team and is based on the best evidence that is currently available on modifiable risk factors for dementia.</p><p>We are asking you to complete the In-MINDD profiler to help us test how well it and the In-MINDD support environment work in practice. We will use the information that you give us to generate a LIfestyle for BRAin Health (LIBRA) profile and score for you. This is a personalised profile highlighting those areas where you are doing well in terms of protecting your brain health and those areas where you might think about making lifestyle/behavioural changes.</p><p>The In-MINDD profiler incorporates four existing validated instruments, which have been carefully selected by the In-MINDD research team and includes images that have been reproduced with kind permission (<a href="index.html?page=profiler#landing-profiler-4">See Acknowledgements</a>).</p>

Randomisation is a way of randomly allocating you to either the In-MINDD or control arm of the trial in a way that the research team cannot dictate or interfere with. You have an equal chance of being assigned to the In-MINDD or control arm. The participant information sheet that you have been given explains what happens if you are randomised to the In-MINDD arm of the trial or to the control arm.
