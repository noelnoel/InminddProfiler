In the trial we are comparing an online dementia risk assessment (the In-MINDD profiler) and internet-based support system (the In-MINDD support environment) with routine practice. The trial is for people aged 40âˆ’60 years in the primary care setting.

landing_profiler_2 = What is the In-MINDD profiler?
landing_profiler_3 = The In-MINDD profiler is an online questionnaire for people aged 40-60 years. It assesses the presence or absence of a range of factors that are known to either increase or decrease a personâ€™s risk of developing dementia in later life. The factors we are assessing are related to lifestyle (e.g. smoking, obesity, physical activity) and can be either modified or managed by lifestyle changes. The In-MINDD profiler has been developed by the In-MINDD research team and the tool is based on the best evidence that is currently available on modifiable risk factors for dementia.
landing_profiler_4 = We are asking you to complete the In-MINDD profiler to help us test how well it and the In-MINDD support environment works in practice. We will use the information that you give us to generate a LIfestyle for BRAin Health (LIBRA) profile and score. This is a personalised profile highlighting those areas where you are doing well in terms of protecting your brain health and those areas where you can think about adopting and adhering to lifestyle behavioural changes.
landing_profiler_5 = What happens after I complete the In-MINDD profiler? 
landing_profiler_6 = Once you have completed the In-MINDD profiler, you will be randomly allocated to either the In-MINDD or control arm of the trial.

You have an equal chance of being assigned to the In-MINDD or control arm. The participant information sheet that you have been given explains what happens if you are randomised to the In-MINDD arm of the trial or to the control arm. The researchers are available to answer any questions that you might have about randomisation.
